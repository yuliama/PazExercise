Exercize instructions:

You are asked to rewrite Paz' old website from scratch using vanilla HTML and CSS.
Link to old Paz site: https://web.archive.org/web/20171018152543/http://www.paz.co.il:80/
You need to build only the home page and the contact page.
Attached in Moodle are screenshots of these pages and a folder with all the images needed to build the site.
Must use Flexbox for the layout
Work step by step and create commits for each "step".
Submit link to github code and link to live site (and have many commits in the repository)
Make the final result as close as possible to the original.
Bonus: For the bottom middle picture add an interval to replace the picture every 5 seconds
Pay attention to
Of course don't copy the code of the original site. For your own sake, don't look at the code (it is awful...). Use the original site's code for learning about sizes of elements and colors, etc.
Don't overuse positioning
Separate Layout and content
Many commits and meaningful messages
Use semantic tags where appropriate (e,g. header, footer, etc.)
Believe in yourself! :)

Fixing the "wayback machine" toolbar
The error in the menu happens because of the wayback machine's toolbar. Here are steps on how to fix the issue

After the site loads open the developer tools (F12)
Locate the body element and right-click on it
Select "Edit as HTML"
Delete the entire part from the comment "BEGIN WAYBACK TOOLBAR INSERT" until the comment "END WAYBACK TOOLBAR INSERT"


Good luck!
